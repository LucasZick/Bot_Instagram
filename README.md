##Instagram Bot

This Python Instagram bot uses Selenium and Geckodriver to log in, search for a given hashtag, load a lot of posts, and start liking them one by one. It has been tested with Firefox, but it may also work with Edge and Google Chrome with some adaptations.

#Usage

Install the necessary packages:
´´´sh
pip install selenium

Download and install Geckodriver.

Change the Geckodriver path in the code to match your installation.

Run the instagramBot.py script with Python:

´´´sh
python instagramBot.py

#Configuration

The bot is highly configurable and can be adapted to work with any Instagram account. Every parameter can be customized, and the code has been extensively commented to help users understand what each line does.

#Note

Please make sure that your system's date and time are correctly set to avoid any "time problems" with the bot.

#Credits

This project was inspired by a Dev Aprender YouTube video, whose link is provided at the top of the code.
