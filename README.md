A python developed Instagram bot that logs in, searches for some hashtag, loads a lot of posts, and starts liking them one by one.\
It runs with selenium and geckodriver(you can change this one).\
Just tried the Firefox Browser, but I think it works on Edge and Google Chrome too with some adaptations.\
You can change every parameter and configure it to every account.\
I've commented almost every line in the code specifying what does it.\
Make sure that your date/time is working well with the browser to avoid some 'time problems' with the code.\

This project was inspired in a 'Dev Aprender' Youtube Channel's video, link on the top of the code.\
Don't forget to change the Geckodriver path to yours.
